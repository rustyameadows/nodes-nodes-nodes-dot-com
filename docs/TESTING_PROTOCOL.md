# Testing Protocol

## Goal
Verify the desktop app in layers so failures are isolated quickly:
1. static correctness
2. build correctness
3. Electron app boot
4. automated unpackaged desktop smoke flow
5. automated packaged mac smoke flow
6. optional manual provider checks

## Baseline Commands
Run these from the repo root:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run check:design-system
npm run test:unit
npm run build
npm run db:generate
```

Mixed Gemini output hardening:
- cover request-shape parity for `Nano Banana 2` `Images & Text` in both `generate` and `edit`
- cover provider normalization for both image+text and image-only mixed responses
- cover worker attempt-persistence for mixed image-only diagnostics and mixed image+text generated descriptors
- cover job-attempt serialization fallback so stored smart text outputs can still hydrate generated descriptors even if explicit descriptor arrays are absent
- cover queue-debug formatting so experimental image-only mixed runs explain “Gemini returned image-only” instead of reading like a renderer failure

Expected results:
- `lint` passes
- `check:design-system` passes
- `test:unit` passes
- `build` emits `dist/renderer` and `dist/electron`
- `db:generate` emits a migration under `drizzle/`

## Primary Desktop Smoke Test
Use the automated Electron smoke flow:

```bash
npm run smoke:electron
```

What it does:
- builds the app
- launches the real Electron app from `dist/electron/main.cjs`
- uses a temporary `NODE_INTERFACE_APP_DATA` directory
- inspects the native application menu from Electron main
- waits for app home
- opens app settings from app home before any project exists
- opens the Node Library from app home
- verifies the Node Library index uses the quiet specimen-first gallery:
  - compact header with home action + inline search only
  - no hero metrics, I/O pills, or display-mode pills on the index
  - each card renders a centered real node specimen with no clipping
  - desktop stays on a stable 3-column gallery instead of a cramped auto-fit 4-up grid
- verifies model, list, and template library detail playgrounds render
- verifies the shared searchable model selector updates the model playground
- verifies Node Library playgrounds boot neutral with no selected node/rails
- verifies the model detail route opens its standalone model fixture in the full shell while still loading unfocused
- verifies the left rail no longer shows a `Display Modes` section
- verifies the bottom canvas overlay row exposes `Compact`, `Preview`, `Edit`, and `Resize`
- verifies the bottom row changes the primary demo node mode without auto-selecting it
- verifies mode switches keep the primary demo node centered in the playground
- verifies those mode switches feel like one motion instead of a resize snap followed by a second recenter jump
- verifies the first click into `Edit` or `Resize` uses the preflight shell size immediately instead of requiring a second click to settle the framing
- verifies repeated `Preview -> Edit -> Resize -> Edit` switches keep the primary node fit-framed instead of clipping the expanded shell
- verifies rapid repeated bottom-row clicks still recenter from the live viewport and do not accumulate left/right or top/bottom drift across mode changes
- verifies the model detail fixture has no upstream prompt note
- verifies uploaded/generated asset detail fixtures render placeholder previews instead of broken images
- verifies generated asset detail keeps the visible model-to-asset connection
- creates a project from the native `File > New Project` menu
- triggers one native `Canvas > Add Model Node` command on canvas
- verifies the inserted model opens directly in the full response-settings shell
- writes a canvas snapshot with two nodes through the live preload bridge
- verifies canvas interaction behavior in the real Electron window:
  - `A` opens the insert menu
  - multi-selected nodes move as one batch
  - `C` connects exactly two selected nodes
  - `Enter` opens the selected node's inline full editor
  - single-click on a `preview` or `compact` model only selects it, keeps its size unchanged, and reveals the shared rails plus the external side run launcher
  - node double-click opens the same primary inline editor mapping on `preview` / `compact` nodes, immediately shows the correct top-left mode pills for the new shell, keeps model full shells open after focus moves away, keeps previously opened full model shells open when a different model is opened next, and fit-zooms from preflight-measured or predicted outer shell bounds without clipping or a follow-up camera chase
  - clicking the top-rail `Default` or `Compact` pills on an expanded node re-anchors from the live available viewport center and triggers the same predictive fit/zoom reframe used by the Node Library mode dock
  - unfocused model nodes that remain in `full` or persisted `resized` keep the large body visible but hide the shared top/bottom rails until refocused
  - double-click on a `resized` node keeps it resized and only focuses the viewport
  - selected model nodes in `preview`, `full`, and persisted `resized` show the bottom-right resize handle, and resize enters `displayMode: "resized"` at drag start and keeps it until `Default` or `Compact`
  - a shared bottom-center selection rail shows `Center` for single selection and `Center Selection` for multi-selection; both fit the selected outer shell bounds without relying on image-only selection state
  - `Cmd/Ctrl+Z` and `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Z` undo/redo batch move, connection, inline edit, and node insertion
  - typing inside inline editors does not trigger canvas shortcuts
  - resized asset nodes can still be dragged after resize
  - list full mode renders as a real editable sheet
  - template full mode keeps chips, editor, and merge preview contained
  - legacy generated nodes are auto-migrated onto one-time spawned-child behavior on reload
- drops an SVG file onto the live canvas and verifies the renderer upload path creates a persisted asset-source node
- navigates through assets, queue, project settings, and app settings through native menu commands
- verifies:
  - preload bridge exists
  - native `File`, `Project`, `Canvas`, `View`, and `Window` menus exist
  - app home app settings works without a project
  - reloading `/` with existing projects stays on app home
  - app home shows archived projects in a separate section when archived projects exist
  - app home can reopen an existing project card
  - `Home` works from the workspace Menu pill and native mac menu
  - light non-canvas views render with the new design-system shell while the main canvas remains black
  - SQLite file is created
  - native new-project and add-node commands round-trip into the renderer
  - Node Library routes and playgrounds render in the real Electron app
  - Node Library index cards render specimen-first stages instead of metadata-heavy cards
  - the canvas insert picker shows registry-driven node labels
  - native model-variant insertion can create a preconfigured model node
  - canvas data round-trips
  - canvas shortcuts stay canvas-scoped and do not fire while a prompt editor or other editable control is focused
  - asset metadata exists
  - asset file exists on disk
  - uploaded asset nodes persist across reload and remain draggable after resize
  - generated-output receipt keys persist in the saved canvas document
  - queue screen renders
  - project settings render with project metadata only
  - provider credentials render in app settings
- writes screenshots into the temp app-data directory, including dedicated adaptive-node visual artifacts

Expected output:
- JSON summary printed to stdout with:
  - `projectId`
  - `appDataRoot`
  - `canvasScreenshotPath`
  - `modelPreviewScreenshotPath`
  - `modelFullScreenshotPath`
  - `nodeLibraryScreenshotPath`
  - `nodeLibraryModelScreenshotPath`
  - `nodeLibraryListScreenshotPath`
  - `nodeLibraryTemplateScreenshotPath`
  - `nodeFocusBeforeScreenshotPath`
  - `nodeFocusScreenshotPath`
  - `listFullScreenshotPath`
  - `templateFullScreenshotPath`
  - `resizedAssetScreenshotPath`
  - `assetsScreenshotPath`
  - `queueScreenshotPath`
  - `projectSettingsScreenshotPath`
  - `appSettingsScreenshotPath`
  - `providerSummary`
  - `nodeLabels`
  - `assetCount`
  - `storedAssetFiles`

Important:
- `npm run smoke:electron` launches the unpackaged Electron runtime from `dist/electron/main.cjs`
- it is expected to look like a generic Electron app in macOS process chrome
- it always uses a temporary `NODE_INTERFACE_APP_DATA` directory

## Packaged Mac Smoke Test
Use the packaged mac smoke flow:

```bash
npm run smoke:packaged:mac
```

What it does:
- builds the app
- packages the unsigned Apple Silicon `.app` and `.zip`
- validates the packaged bundle metadata and unpacked native modules
- launches the packaged `.app` executable through Selenium + `electron-chromedriver`
- uses a temporary `NODE_INTERFACE_APP_DATA` directory so it does not touch your manual packaged-app data
- verifies:
  - branded bundle metadata and icon wiring
  - preload bridge availability
  - app home render
  - Node Library gallery render with centered specimen cards
  - one model detail playground screenshot
  - one list detail playground screenshot
  - app settings render with provider credentials before any project exists
  - project creation
  - canvas round-trip
  - model full screenshot capture
  - list full screenshot capture
  - template full screenshot capture
  - synthetic canvas drag/drop upload creates a persisted asset and asset-source node
  - assets view render after the canvas upload
  - queue view render
  - project settings render without provider credentials
  - app settings render with provider credentials
  - packaged SQLite and on-disk asset persistence

Expected output:
- JSON summary printed to stdout with:
  - `appPath`
  - `executablePath`
  - `zipPath`
  - `appDataRoot`
  - `projectId`
  - screenshot paths
  - `providerSummary`

Important:
- `npm run smoke:packaged:mac` targets the packaged `.app`, not the unpackaged dev runtime
- it may briefly open a second packaged-app window while it runs
- it does not reuse your manual packaged-app data root

## Full Lifecycle Verification
Use the end-to-end mac lifecycle command:

```bash
npm run verify:mac-lifecycle
```

It runs:
1. `npm run smoke:packaged:mac`
2. `node --import tsx scripts/print-mac-artifacts.ts`

The final artifact summary prints the `.app`, executable, and `.zip` paths.

## Dev-App Verification
For interactive testing:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This should:
- start Vite on `http://localhost:5173`
- watch-build Electron main/preload/worker bundles
- launch Electron against the dev server

Important:
- `npm run dev` is the unpackaged source-run app
- it is separate from the packaged `.app`
- if both are open at once, they are different processes and may use different data roots

If `npm run dev` fails with `Port 5173 is already in use`, clear the stale dev server first:

```bash
lsof -nP -iTCP:5173 -sTCP:LISTEN
kill <pid>
```

## Browser-Only Renderer Smoke
When debugging renderer UI separate from preload/main:

1. run `npm run dev`
2. open `http://localhost:5173`

The renderer has a browser fallback bridge for smoke inspection only. Use this for:
- app home rendering
- route rendering
- CSS/token verification
- quick TanStack Router/Query checks

Do not treat browser fallback mode as a substitute for Electron smoke.

## Manual Desktop Checklist
Run this when touching workflow or asset UX:

1. Launch `npm run dev`.
2. Confirm app home renders.
3. Open App Settings from home and return to home.
4. Open Node Library from home.
5. Open the model detail page and confirm the shared searchable model selector works.
6. Open the list and template detail pages and confirm their playgrounds are interactive.
7. Return home and create a project from app home.
8. Confirm the canvas route loads.
9. Open Home from the in-app `Menu` pill and confirm the project card is visible.
10. Reopen the project from home.
11. Add or restore at least one text note and one model node.
12. Open the add-node picker and confirm registry-driven entries such as `Add List / Sheet`, `Add Template Node`, and `Add Uploaded Assets` are present.
13. Multi-select two nodes and drag them together.
14. Press `C` with exactly two selected nodes and confirm a connection is created.
15. Press `Enter` on a single selected node and confirm the expected inline full editor opens.
16. Double-click a `preview` or `compact` node and confirm it opens the same primary inline editor as `Enter` with a gentle viewport focus animation.
17. Double-click a model node from `preview` or `compact`, click empty canvas, then double-click a second model node and confirm the first model still stays in `full`.
18. Double-click a `resized` node and confirm it stays resized while the viewport focuses to it.
19. Click into a prompt, note, list cell, or template textarea and confirm canvas shortcuts do not fire while typing.
20. Resize a text/list/template/asset node and confirm the size persists after deselecting or reloading.
21. Open a template node with a connected list and confirm variable chips, compatibility state, and merge preview render inline.
22. Open a list node in full mode and confirm it behaves like an inline editable sheet instead of the old stacked field controls.
23. Resize an asset node, then drag it directly from the media surface and confirm it still moves cleanly.
24. Confirm phantom output previews appear only for the active node and disappear when you deselect or change selection.
25. Use `Cmd/Ctrl+Z` and `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Z` to undo/redo one move, one connection, and one inline edit.
26. If a generated child node exists, resize or edit it, wait through at least one jobs poll, reload, and confirm it does not revert.
27. Delete a generated child node, reload, and confirm it does not respawn.
28. Import an asset.
28. Open the Assets view and confirm the imported asset appears.
29. Open Project Settings and confirm the project metadata renders and provider credentials do not appear there.
30. Open App Settings and confirm provider credentials render there.
31. Confirm the workspace menu, queue pill, insert picker, bottom-bar popovers, and bottom-center canvas selection rail all use the refreshed chrome without changing canvas node or connection rendering.
32. Confirm focus-visible, disabled buttons, and compact-density tables/filters still read clearly on home, settings, queue, and assets.
33. If testing on macOS, confirm:
   - `File`, `Project`, `Canvas`, `Edit`, `View`, and `Window` menus appear
   - `Cmd+,` opens App Settings
   - `File > New Project` opens a new project
   - `Project > Home` returns to app home
   - `Project > Assets` / `Queue` / `Project Settings` match the in-app menu behavior
   - `Canvas > Add Node…`, `Connect Selected Nodes`, `Duplicate Selected Node`, `Undo Canvas Change`, and `Redo Canvas Change` enable or disable correctly on canvas
34. If API keys are configured, run at least one real provider job and verify:
  - queue row created
  - state changes visible
  - queue rows open the full execution record directly; there is no secondary summary inspector on the list page
  - output lands on canvas or in assets as appropriate
  - rerunning appends a fresh set of generated child nodes instead of replacing earlier ones

## Manual Packaged-App Checklist
Run this against the packaged `.app` after `npm run package:mac`:

1. Open `release/mac-arm64/Nodes Nodes Nodes.app` from Finder.
2. Confirm the app name and pink icon appear in macOS chrome.
3. Open App Settings.
4. Save an OpenAI or Topaz key to Keychain.
5. Confirm provider readiness updates without editing `.env.local`.
6. Create or open a project.
7. Run a real node.
8. Confirm queue progress and final output persistence.
9. Quit and relaunch the packaged app.
10. Confirm the project reopens and Keychain-backed readiness persists.
11. Confirm the native `Project` and `Canvas` menus behave the same as the unpackaged app.

## Troubleshooting

### Blank Electron window
Check:
- Electron dev process is using `NODE_ENV=development`
- `ELECTRON_RENDERER_URL` points at `http://localhost:5173`
- no stale `dist/electron` cleanup is racing Electron restarts

### Preload missing in dev
Symptoms:
- black window
- `Unable to load preload script`
- `window.nodeInterface` missing

Check:
- `tsup` watch build is not cleaning `dist/electron` on every rebuild
- `dist/electron/preload.cjs` exists before Electron restart

### App works in browser but not Electron
That usually means a preload/main problem, not a React problem. Re-run:

```bash
npm run smoke:electron
```

and inspect the printed temp `appDataRoot` plus screenshots.

When adaptive-node work changes, inspect these screenshot artifacts first:
- `canvas-model-preview.png`
- `canvas-model-full.png`
- `canvas-list-full.png`
- `canvas-template-full.png`
- `canvas-resized-asset.png`

## When To Update This Doc
Update this protocol when any of these change:
- app run commands
- build commands
- smoke-test command or coverage
- Electron boot path
- mac packaging or packaged-app verification flow
- required verification steps for canvas/assets/queue flows
